=== Compact Privacy Pages ===
Contributors: Clorith
Requires at least: 4.6
Tested up to: 4.9
Stable tag: 1.1.0

== Description ==

Privacy pages often include a lot of text, making it hard to keep track of what is going on, and what sections you really want ot look up.

This plugin will split up your Privacy Page into an accordion, revealing headings by default and allowing the reader to toggle which section they wish to look into at any given time.

It will pick up any `<h2>` tags (or `Heading 2` in the WordPress editor), and puts any text following these in a collapsed state.

Any text you wish to have always displayed, for example contact information, should be put early on in your page, before you start introducing any section headers.

Prior to WordPress 4.9.6, a meta box is on the side of your pages where you can mark a Privacy Page, after 4.9.6 is released the plugin will automatically use the option chosen under `Tools > Privacy`.

== Installation ==

1. Upload to your plugins folder, usually `wp-content/plugins/`
2. Activate the plugin on the plugin screen.
3. Write your Privacy page

== Screenshots ==
